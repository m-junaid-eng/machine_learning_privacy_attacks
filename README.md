<p><strong>Author:</strong> Muhammad Junaid<br>
<strong>Roll Number:</strong> BITF22M035</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This repository contains a research project on privacy attacks targeting modern machine learning systems. 
As machine learning models rely on large volumes of sensitive data, they are vulnerable to multiple privacy threats. 
This project investigates attacks such as membership inference, model inversion, and data poisoning, 
and evaluates different defense techniques including differential privacy and secure multi-party computation.
</p>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Study and classify major machine learning privacy attacks.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate practical examples of selected attacks using small-scale datasets.</li>
  <li>Evaluate and analyze defense mechanisms for privacy preservation.</li>
  <li>Provide recommendations for secure deployment of machine learning models.</li>
</ul>
